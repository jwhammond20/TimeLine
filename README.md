# TimeLine

I built a custom HTML and CSS timeline for joshwilliam.com to showcase my past work experience in a visually appealing way. The timeline includes details of my employment history, along with the roles and responsibilities I held at each job. 

The design of the timeline was inspired by modern web design trends and was customized to match the overall style of joshwilliam.com. I used my expertise in HTML and CSS to create a responsive and user-friendly timeline that is easy to navigate.

To view the timeline, simply visit joshwilliam.com and navigate to the 'Experience' section.
