            As a co-founder and web developer/designer at Dynasty Media LLC, I
            played a critical role in launching and growing a successful online
            brand and website in the fantasy football space. I utilized various
            tools and programming languages to design and develop custom web
            architecture, resulting in a seamless and optimized user experience.
            By analyzing user feedback and analytics, I was able to continuously
            improve the website's interface. I also collaborated with data
            scientists and software engineers to develop proprietary
            applications and implemented SEO tactics that resulted in increased
            traffic and rankings. My efforts ultimately contributed to the
            growth of the company, with a significant increase in followers,
            monthly visits, and paid memberships.

            As the former owner and operator of a small hardwood flooring
            installation and refinishing company, I successfully managed all
            aspects of the business, from sales and marketing to project
            management and installation. I took pride in delivering high-quality
            craftsmanship and exceptional customer service to each of my
            clients. With extensive knowledge and experience in hardwood
            flooring, I worked closely with each client to understand their
            unique needs and preferences, and was dedicated to delivering
            outstanding results that exceeded expectations. Through my
            commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction, I built a loyal
            client base and a reputation for being a trusted and reliable
            provider of hardwood flooring services
